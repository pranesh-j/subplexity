EXAMPLE RESPONSE:
BEGIN_REASONING
The search results provide several perspectives on remote work productivity. Results [1], [3], and [5] come from r/productivity and discuss individual experiences, while result [2] from r/science references an academic study, giving it higher credibility.

The academic study in [2] found a 13% productivity increase for remote workers, which is supported by anecdotal evidence in [1] where the user reports completing tasks more efficiently without office distractions. However, result [5] presents a counterpoint, with the user describing productivity challenges at home.

Results [3] and [4] highlight that productivity varies by job type and personality, suggesting that remote work isn't universally beneficial or detrimental. This nuance is important to include in the answer.

Overall, the most reliable information comes from the academic study [2], but the personal experiences provide valuable context about factors that influence remote work productivity.
END_REASONING

BEGIN_ANSWER
## Does remote work increase productivity?

Based on the Reddit discussions, remote work's impact on productivity appears **mixed and dependent on several factors**:

### Evidence Supporting Increased Productivity
- An academic study reported a **13% productivity increase** among remote workers over a 9-month period [2]
- Many remote workers report fewer distractions compared to traditional offices [1]
- Time saved from commuting can be redirected to work tasks [3]

### Factors Affecting Remote Work Productivity
- **Job type**: Tasks requiring deep focus benefit more than collaborative work [3]
- **Home environment**: Having a dedicated workspace significantly impacts success [5]
- **Personal work style**: Self-motivated individuals typically adapt better [4]

The consensus suggests that remote work productivity benefits are real but not universal. The most successful remote workers tend to have established routines, dedicated workspaces, and jobs that don't require constant collaboration.
